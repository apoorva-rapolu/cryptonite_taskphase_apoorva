## Welcome
flag was already given
```
OASIS{h411!d4y_says_w41c0m3_t0_7h3_04515}
```

## Flagged
the flag was found in `#rules` of discord OASIS server
```
OASIS{0H_SN4P_Y0U_F0UND_M3_1N_7H3_D3SCR1P710N}
```

## I swear it's right there
found in the caption of instagram page of OASIS
```
oasis{easy_osinsta}
```

## Ready player one?
the attachement had an audio file with morse code  which translates to:
```
OASIS{M0R5E_M4N1PU7IA70R}
```

## Arte-Miss?
found the meta data of the given photo from `https://www.metadata2go.com/` and found the flag under artist's name:
```
OASIS{m4ta_af_04515}
```

## String me to sleep
grepping the file to find the flag from the library file given 
```
OASIS{y0u_fou7d_m3}
```

## This or That
by using an online XOR cipher decoder `https://md5decrypt.net/en/Xor/` with <br>
Ciphertext - `036363127c7c60001a117c6463170b` with input type `hexadecimal` <br>
key - `ARTEMIS_WHISPER` with key type `text` <br>
we get output in `text` as `B17W153_MY573RY` <br>
the flag is in the format:
```
OASIS{B17W153_MY573RY}
```
## Jekylle and Hide!


## Keynough is enough
from the clue word `vineger`, it is clear that the txt is a `vigenere cipher` <br>
from an online vigenere cipher decoder `https://www.cs.du.edu/~snarayan/crypt/vigenere.html` <br>
ciphertext - `KHAAH{W1C3J7_C1O3F3G3}` <br>

key - `WHISPER` <br>
we get `oasis{s1l3n7_v1g3n3r3}`, but the flag is in the form OASIS{ALL_CAPS}. So the flag is :
```
OASIS{S113N7_V1G3N3R3}
```
## BasiKEllY
given code is `J5AVGSKTPNWDA53LGN4V65BQGBPXGMDGORPXG4BQNMZW4XZTNB6Q====` <br>
using a cyberchef decoder we get the output and the flag :
```
OASIS{l0wk3y_t00_s0ft_sp0k3n_3h}
```
